> # About me

I am a young enthusiast with programming, who seeks to grow in the area and work, as well as learn new technologies and adapt to the market according to their needs.
I am a very practical person in the logical part with a great development in mathematics, having a certificate of honorable mention at Obmep 
(Brazilian Public School Mathematics Olympiad- 2021). 
Anyway, this is me, a young man open to new vacancies and willing to face new experiences and develop new skills.
I'm from Brazil, more specifically from Patos, Pb.
I'm 16 years old. I'm starting my first career after high school and next year I'll be joining the faculty of systems analysis and development
